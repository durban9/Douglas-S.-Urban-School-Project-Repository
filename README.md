Welcome to my repository on GitHub.

In these folders you will find that you have access to school projects of mine from this current semester.
Some projects are simple console programs, some projects are more complex GUI programs. 
All programs are coded in the Java language, and all programs are coded to specifications by myself. 
All programs are available as either a .zip file or in folder form, complete with the .java file.
I am enthusiastic about coding and both what it can do and what I can do for the future. I am looking to change careers, and I truly feel that a career in coding is the change which I seek.  Please email me at douglas.urban@gmail.com with any questions that you may have. I am eager to hear from you!

Thanks you, again, for taking the time to review my work and consider my candidacy for LaunchCode.

Sincerely, 

Douglas S. Urban
